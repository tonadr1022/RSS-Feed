An RSS Feed reader developed with Express.js and React. Add RSS feeds, sort them into categories, view latest feeds without request limits. Does not support streaming (refresh required to reload feed). A work in progress!

### Planned Potential Features
- image support on article viewer
- better error handling and error UI
- feed suggestions/list
- Automatically find feed given YouTube channel or subreddit
